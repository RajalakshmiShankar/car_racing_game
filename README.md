<h1 align="center">Simple Car Racing Game ðŸš˜ in Python</h1>

The Simple Car Racing Game is an interactive 2D racing game created using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The game features a player-controlled car that moves left and right on a road, avoiding falling obstacles. The objective is to survive as long as possible while collecting points for every successfully avoided obstacle. As the player progresses, the difficulty increases with faster obstacles, creating a more challenging gameplay experience.

The game uses basic collision detection to determine when the car collides with an obstacle, resulting in the game-ending. The playerâ€™s score is displayed on the screen, increasing with each obstacle avoided. The speed of the falling obstacles also scales as the player accumulates points, providing a progressively harder challenge.

The gameâ€™s primary components include:<br>
  =>Car Control: Movement of the car using arrow keys.<br>
  =>Obstacles: Falling obstacles that the player must avoid.<br>
  =>Score System: A scoring mechanism that increases based on successful evasion of obstacles.<br>
  =>Collision Detection: Detects when the car collides with an obstacle, ending the game.<br>

This project serves as an introduction to basic game development concepts such as handling user input, object movement, and collision detection, while providing an engaging and simple gaming experience.
